Requirements

pip3 install random-username
pip3 install python-anticaptcha
pip3 install selenium

Note:
set iteration veriable for required enteries.
log.csv will keep record of enteries

Intentionally put some sleep commands to behave as a human
when captcha solution is wrong from API side then it will say wrong capthca solution
simply wait for next iteration
